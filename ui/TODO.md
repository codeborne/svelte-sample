# Additions to components

## New

* Button group component
* ✅ ~~Toast component~~
* Transition wrapper to support tailwind animation state transitions

## Improvements

* Spinner to look nicer by default
* Button color (primary, success, violet etc) and variant (solid, soft, ghost) to be separated.
* ✅ ~~Button and Icon to include xs size by default~~
* ✅ ~~Icons to support stroke-width customisation~~

* ✅ ~~Card component to support some sm, default and lg sizes~~
* ✅ ~~Name copying functionality for icon names on the icon samples page~~

## Theming

* By default only light theme, like it is now
  OR
* Include also dark by default and make it easy to get rid of it when not needed (e.g dark theme related styles always
  on a separate line in style clauses make them easy to read and remove)

## Prototype only components

Some components that are continuously needed in prototypes, it could be useful to have them included in samples.

* ✅~~E-mail mocking base~~
* ✅~~Mocking menu (log-in helper, mocking different results in flows)~~
* Simple login with different roles
